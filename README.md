# **CO2 Emission Data Analysis**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of CO2 emission data. The analysis aims to uncover insights and answer critical environmental and policy-related questions to inform decision-making processes.

## **Tools Used**

- **Python**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- Pandas and HvPlot: For Visualization.

## **Objectives and Key Questions**

The primary objective of this analysis is to extract actionable insights from the CO2 emission data. Some key questions addressed through the visualization include:

- How have global CO2 emissions changed over time?
- Which Region are the largest contributors to CO2 emissions?
- What are the trends in CO2 emissions by GDP per capita (e.g., transportation, industry, residential)?
- What are the CO2 emission trends over time per GDP per capita?

## **Insights from the Visualization**

The visualizations created in Power BI provided several key insights, including:

1. Europe has the highest co2 emission
2. Regions with GDP on the higher end tend to have smaller co2 emission deviation.
3. There has been a stark increase in the CO2 levels over the 5 year period cover in the data (particularly between 1800 - 1840).

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. **Power BI Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file (**`CO2EmissionDataAnalysis.pbix`**) to explore the interactive dashboard.
2. **Data Files**: Access the raw data files in the **`data`** directory to understand the dataset used for analysis.
3. **Documentation**: Refer to the **`documentation`** directory for detailed notes on data preprocessing, transformation, and the methodology used in the analysis.
